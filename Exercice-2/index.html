    <p>
        Create a progressbar. 
        It must have 2 parts, one will be colored and the other without color to see the progress of the progressbar. 
        To do this we will use the class "drawBar". 
        It contains 2 arguments : "sum" to get the total sum of the number and "nbr" to get the proportion oh the charged segment of the progressbar. 
        It must be 100% responsive to the size of its html container
